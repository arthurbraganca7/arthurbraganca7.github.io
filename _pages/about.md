I am a senior economist at [The World Bank Environment Department](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/environment).

My interests lie at the intersection of environmental, development, and public economics. 

My research has been published in peer-reviewed journals such as *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)*, *Journal of Public Economics*, and *Journal of Development Economics*.

My complete CV is available [here](http://arthurbraganca7.github.io/files/CV_Arthur.pdf).
