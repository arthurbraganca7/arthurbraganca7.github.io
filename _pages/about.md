I am a senior economist at the [World Bank Environment Global Practice](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/environment).

Before joining the World Bank, I was a Head of Policy Evaluation at the [Climate Policy Initiative](https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/) and a lecturer at [PUC-Rio](https://www.econ.puc-rio.br/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of environmental, development, and public economics. My research has been published in peer-reviewed journals such as *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)* and *Journal of Public Economics*.

My complete CV is available [here](http://arthurbraganca7.github.io/files/CV_Arthur.pdf).
