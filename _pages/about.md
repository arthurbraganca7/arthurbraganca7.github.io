I am a senior economist at [The World Bank Environment Department](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/environment).

My interests lie at the intersection of environmental, development, and public economics. 

My research has been published in peer-reviewed journals such as [PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/), [Journal of Public Economics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-public-economics), and [Journal of Development Economics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-development-economics).

My complete CV is available [here](http://arthurbraganca7.github.io/files/CV_Arthur.pdf).
